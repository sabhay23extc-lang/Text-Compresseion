# Text-Compresseion
Text compression reduces the size of text data by encoding it more efficiently, removing redundancy, and storing information in fewer bits. It can be lossless (no data lost, e.g., Huffman, LZW) or lossy (some data lost for higher compression). It helps save storage and speed up data transmission.
